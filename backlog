1. Code Organization
Modularize Components: The components folder could be further organized into subfolders based on functionality (e.g., ui, layouts, gallery). This will make it easier to locate and manage components.
Centralize Configuration: Move all configuration files (e.g., tailwind.config.ts, postcss.config.js, eslint.config.js) into a dedicated config folder for better organization.

2. Code Quality
TypeScript Strict Mode: Ensure tsconfig.json has strict mode enabled to catch potential type errors early.
Linting and Formatting: Use tools like ESLint and Prettier to enforce consistent code style across the project.
Unit Tests: Add unit tests for critical components and features using a testing library like Jest or React Testing Library.

3. Performance
Lazy Loading: Implement lazy loading for routes and components to improve initial load time.
Image Optimization: Optimize images in the images and screenshots folders using tools like sharp or imagemin.

4. User Experience
Dark Mode: Add support for dark mode using Tailwind's dark mode utilities.
Accessibility: Ensure all components are accessible (e.g., proper ARIA roles, keyboard navigation).
Responsive Design: Verify that all pages and components are fully responsive, especially for mobile devices.

5. Documentation
README.md: Expand the README.md file to include setup instructions, project structure, and contribution guidelines.
Component Documentation: Use tools like Storybook to document and showcase UI components.

6. Security
Environment Variables: Ensure sensitive data (e.g., API keys) is stored securely in .env files and not hardcoded.
Authentication: Review the auth feature for potential vulnerabilities and ensure secure token storage.

7. Build and Deployment
CI/CD Pipeline: Set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions or another tool to automate testing and deployment.
Bundle Analysis: Use tools like webpack-bundle-analyzer or vite-plugin-analyzer to identify and reduce large bundle sizes.

8. Feature Enhancements
Screenshot Gallery: Enhance the ScreenshotGallery component to support filtering or categorization of screenshots.
AI Assistant: Add more interactive features to the AIAssistant page, such as voice input or real-time suggestions.

9. Error Handling #DONE
Global Error Boundary: Implement a global error boundary to catch and display errors gracefully.
Toast Notifications: Use the use-toast hook to provide consistent feedback for user actions.

10. Developer Experience
Hot Module Replacement (HMR): Ensure HMR is enabled for faster development feedback.
Debugging Tools: Integrate tools like React DevTools and Redux DevTools for easier debugging.
