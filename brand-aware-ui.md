## Prompt Start

I am building a professional web application using:
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Vite as the build tool
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- All components follow functional React design using hooks and modern composition
- Files follow modular structure: `src/components`, `src/pages`, `src/features`, etc.

---

Assume the Tailwind CSS theme inside: ./tailwind.config.ts file


Brand tone: clean, modern, professional. Avoid playful or decorative styling. Use whitespace generously. Typography should emphasize readability.

---

Component Guidelines:
- All React components must be functional and typed with interfaces
- Use TypeScript
